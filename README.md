### Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github page ðŸ¥°

- ðŸ”­ - I am in the process of refining my [repository of algorithmic contest templates](https://github.com/qxf-72/Codeforces-Cpp), as well as gradually posting some of my study notes on my Github.

- ðŸŒ± - Considering that the reading experience of pure Markdown is not very good, I plan to publish notes on my [yuque knowledge garden](https://www.yuque.com/xiaofeng_garden), and organize the directory on Github at the same time, which can be linked to the corresponding chapter of the yuque knowledge garden.

- ðŸ˜„ - Welcome to visit my [leetcode homepage](https://leetcode-cn/u/qxf-u/) and [codeforces homepage](https://codeforces.com/profile/qiuxiaofeng), hoping to meet like-minded friends to brush questions together.

- ðŸ’¬ - Welcome to leave a message on my Github, I will reply as soon as possible.
